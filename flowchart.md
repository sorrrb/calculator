# Workspace Ideas

> Complete basic math operations
- Create functions which take two operands and:
  - Adds them
  - Subtracts them
  - Multiplies them
  - Divides them

- Create a function operate() which takes two number parameters and calls one of the above functions on those two numbers

- Establish base style for calculator display/interface
  - Implement +, -, *, /, =, %, Â± function buttons
  - Implement clear button
  - Implement decimal button (floating point number support)

- Implement logic pertaining to numerical input into the calculator
  - Actively store value on display in variable

- Track value that is displayed when an operation is clicked, as well as operation

- Await next operation input (following some-level of numerical input) and call operate() function using tracked operation & value

- Implement chained expression logic if mathematical equivalence (=) button is not clicked
